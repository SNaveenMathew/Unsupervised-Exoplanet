## Introduction

`Transit method` is used to detect the presence of exoplanets around distant stars. Here's a helpful visualization:

## Data

<font size="3">

- Data was obtained from the Kepler space telescope. Data format: time series (equal intervals) with some missing data
- Only the light flux was used.
- Data is not as clean as expected.
    - Universe is large - stars exhibit variable brightness at large distances due to several phenomenon.
    - Not all crests and troughs are relevant.

```{r fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.align='center'}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("example.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Components

```{r warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4}
img <- readPNG("flow.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Results 1: Learning

```{r warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4}
img <- readPNG("kplr001026957_q1_q16_tce_01_dvt_lc.tbl_learning.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Results 2: Testing

```{r warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
img <- readPNG("test_example.png")
grid.raster(img)
```


## Scope for Improvement

- Hyperparameters such as sequence length, number of hidden units in LSTM layers, number of dense layers, number of neurons in dense layer, etc. can be tuned.
- An algorithm can be used to perform phase folding to identify number of planets and period of revolution of each planet around the star. This will also enrich the data.
