## Introduction

`Transit method` is used to detect the presence of exoplanets around distant stars. Here's a helpful visualization:

## Data

<font size="3">

- Data was obtained from the Kepler space telescope. Data format: time series (equal intervals) with some missing data
- Only the light flux was used.
- Data is not as clean as expected.
    - Universe is large - stars exhibit variable brightness at large distances due to several phenomenon.
    - Not all crests and troughs are relevant.

```{r fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.align='center'}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("example.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Components

```{r warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4}
img <- readPNG("flow.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

**LSTM autoencoder hyperparameters:**

- Train-validation-test: 42%, 28%, 30%
- Sequence length = 10
- Layers: input (9, 1), LSTM (64), droupout (0.2), LSTM (256), droupout (0.2), LSTM (100), droupout (0.2), dense (9, 1)
- Loss: Mean square error

## Results: Learning and Testing

```{r warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=10, fig.height=4.5}
img <- readPNG("test_examples.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Scope for Improvement

- Hyperparameters such as sequence length, number of hidden units in LSTM layers, number of dense layers, number of neurons in dense layer, etc. can be tuned.
- An algorithm can be used to perform phase folding to identify number of planets and period of revolution of each planet around the star. This will also enrich the data.
